# Segmented anisotropic ssTEM dataset of neural tissue

The ground truth stack 1 contains 20 sections from serial section Transmission Electron Microscopy (ssTEM) of the Drosophila melanogaster third instar larva ventral nerve cord. The cube measures 4.7 x 4.7 x 1 microns approx, with a resolution of 4.6 x 4.6 nm/pixel and section thickness of 45-50 nm.

You are free to use this data set for the purpose of generating or testing non-commercial image segmentation software. If any scientific publications derive from the usage of this data set, you must cite:

### Modifications

The following modifications have been applied to the orginal dataset:
- All images are converted to portable network graphics (png) format
- All file names are numbers 00~19
- Labels contain a combination of membranes, mitochondria, synapses. For oriented membranes, junctions, glia/extracellular space etc. see original dataset.

### TODO

Three-dimensional segmentation into neurons/regions.

### The challenge
Use *stack 1* to train pixel classifiers for the purpose of automatic segmentation of neural structures in ssTEM. For instance, use 80% of the sections to train, and 20% of the sections for validation. Apply the classifier to the raw data of *stack 2* (test data) and send us the results, so we're able to compute pixel-wise and other error measures in the subsequent neuron reconstruction pipeline.
